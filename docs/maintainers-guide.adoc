== Overview

This document describes a preliminary patch-based workflow for maintaining
`radicle-link`. We adopt this to familiarise ourselves with fully distributed
collaboration and cut our reliance on proprietary hosting platforms. As
`radicle-link` stabilises, expect things to change, and be replaced by our own
stack.

NOTE: This document describes an experimental workflow, and is expected to be
amended by 2021-10-12

== Prerequisites

Read link:submitting-patches.adoc[Submitting Patches] first.

== Overview

Below is described a somewhat simplified version of ``git.git``'s workflow. The
most notable difference is that we don't maintain a second long lived branch
besides `master`, as we don't at this point need a stabilisation or QA phase
before releasing.

== Setup

For the purpose of this experiment, we rotate maintainership duties on a
week-by-week basis. At the end of each week, we publish a "release" by tagging
the state of the `master` branch. Conventionally, these tags should be of the
form `cycle/DATE-OF-CYLCE-CLOSING`, e.g. `cycle/2021-09-21`.

When it is your turn as a maintainer, create a branch `seen` off of the most
recent `cycle` tag. You will use this branch to "queue" patches before merging
them to `master`. Think of this as a staging area which allows you to resolve
conflicts (or ask the patch submitter), and to run CI before committing to
`master`.

NOTE: The history of the `seen` branch is expected to be rewritten, as patches
are dropped or reordered before being promoted to `master`.

If there are unmerged patches in the `seen` branch of the previous cycle's
maintainer, you may decide to build on top of their branch, or re-queue any of
the outstanding patches yourself.

It is a good idea to publish your `seen` branch, e.g under your github account.

== Applying patches

You'll want to track patches each in its own topic branch, e.g.
`kim/rewrite-everything`. If the submitter has published their patch, that's as
easy as adding their origin as a remote.  Otherwise, create a tracking branch
locally and apply the patches from the emails.

You'll also want to promote patches to `master` quickly as they become stable,
in order to avoid having to massage the history of `seen` repeatedly (and
potentially having to resolve conflicts). In case more than one patch is
in-flight, the following strategy is recommended:

.  Apply any already-approved patches
+
You may run CI now, and if it passes promote the patches to `master` already.
. Apply small patches
. Apply the rest (use your judgement to order them by stability)
. Run CI
. Notify people if something broke

As rerolls are coming in, you may need to reorder patches. You may also need to
replace previously applied patches with a revisited version. While keeping the
`master` history somewhat linear is desirable, you may want to apply long-ish
series with a merge commit -- when `git rebase -i`-ing `seen`, you can then just
drop the patch by dropping the merge commit. If you do this, please make sure to
include a summary of the series being merged, and a list of the commits it pulls
in in the commit message (see `git.git` for examples).

== Approval

We don't (yet) employ a very formal patch approval process. Replying to the
(first message) of the patch with some utterance of approval is enough. It is up
to the current maintainer to decide if enough approvals have been gathered, if
unsure, ask.

Amending the commit(s) to add `Reviewed-By`, `Approved-By`, `Praised-By`, or
whatever attribution-carrying git trailers is thus not required, but may enhance
overall entertainment.

== Patch Status + Release

At the beginning of a cycle, send out an email with the subject "Release cycle
DATE-OF-CYCLE-CLOSING". Include the URL of where you intend to publish `seen`,
enumerate patches carried over from the last cycle, and any new ones.

Whenever a patch moves from `seen` to `master`, reply to this email to say which
ones made it. Also reply if you're unsure about promoting to `master`.

On the day the cycle ends, tag your `master` as described above, and publish it
wherever you have access to (i.e. `radicle-dev/radicle-link`). The tag message
should describe what went into the release, if there are breaking changes, etc.
It should **not** list the individual commits, as that information is available
through `git log`. The tag **must** be signed with the maintainer's GPG key.

WARNING: Make sure to use `git push tag cycle/XYZ`, **not** `git push --tags`.

Reply a last time to the cycle email. Information to include: URL of where to
retrieve the tag on the web, patches which **did not** make it into the release
(so the next maintainer can pick them up).
