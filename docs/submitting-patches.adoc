== Overview

This document describes a preliminary patch-based workflow for contributing to
`radicle-link`. We adopt this to familiarise ourselves with fully distributed
collaboration and cut our reliance on proprietary hosting platforms. As
`radicle-link` stabilises, expect things to change, and be replaced by our own
stack.

NOTE: This document describes an experimental workflow, and is expected to be
amended by 2021-10-12

== Prerequisites

Patches are to be submitted via link:https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email[git
send-email] for review. For a blitz introduction, refer to
link:https://git-send-email.io[https://git-send-email.io]

== Submitting patches

- For now, base your work off of the `master` branch published to
  link:https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-link[github]

- Send patches to
mailto:~radicle-link/dev@lists.sr.ht[~radicle-link/dev@lists.sr.ht] using `git
send-email`

- During review, make sure to keep CC lists intact. This allows people to
participate without subscribing to the mailing list.

- For your own and the reviewers/maintainers convenience, consider to push your
patch (series) to a git server as well (eg. your github, sr.ht, ...). This will
allow you to run CI before submitting (if there's no build definition for your
platform in the `radicle-link` repo -- patches welcome!).
+
If you do this, let reviewers know by including a URL in your cover letter,
e.g. as a git trailer:
+
    Published-As: https://github.com/kim/radicle-link/tree/my-patch
+
It is a good idea to point this URL to a signed tag of the current iteration
of your patch, e.g. `patches/my-patch/v1`. An example trailer for github would
then look like:
+
    Published-As: https://github.com/kim/radicle-link/releases/tag/patches/my-patch/v1

- Keep in mind that, unlike with PRs, people will look at the individual commits
of your patch. So make sure the commits are self-contained, not too big not
too small, and carry context information in their commit messages. If you're
submitting a patch series, make sure to include a cover letter (`git send-email
--compose`, `git format-patch --cover-letter`) which serves roughly the same
purpose as a PR description (i.e. it is usually not included verbatim in the
commit history). Additional commentary (e.g. "I did this, but am not sure
because...") goes after the three dashes of each patch.
+
In general, a good commit message is of the form:
+
----
subsystem: what

The whys and the hows.

Signed-off-by: A U Thor <au.thor@example.com>
----

== Responding to review

- Reviewers may comment on invividual commits, or on the cover letter. It is
considered polite to respond to every comment and let reviewers know if you have
questions, if you plan to address the feedback, or if you don't, why not. It is
also okay to summarise which comments you've addressed in your reroll's cover
letter -- but make sure you CC'ed the reviewer.

- After you've addressed the feedback, tidy up your commit history using `git
rebase -i`. You're now ready to "reroll" the patch. Conventionally, the patch
subject is changed to reflect the _revision_ of the patch, and the email is sent
as a reply to your original patch (for all subsequent revisions). This is done
via the `-v` and `--in-reply-to` switches, e.g.:
+
    git send-email -v2 --to=~radicle-link/dev@lists.sr.ht \
        --in-reply-to="<20210902113703.GD7400@schmidt.localdomain>"
+
The `Message-Id` header to use for the `In-Reply-To` can be found behind the
"Details" or "Export" links in the web UI. Mind the angle brackets!
